  * Better sanity checks prior to installation (<a href="https://github.com/binaryage/asepsis/issues/25">issue #25</a>).
  * 'clean' task renamed to 'reset' task to prevent confusion.

1.5 - July 27, 2014
  + Compatibility with OS X 10.10. [Yosemite]
  * Asepsis updater reports errors via notification instead of alert box (<a href="https://github.com/binaryage/asepsis/issues/14">issue #14</a>).
  * asepsisctl migratein preserves file attributed (<a href="https://github.com/binaryage/asepsis/issues/12">issue #12</a>).

  - OS X 10.7 is no longer supported. [Lion]

1.4.1 - May 24, 2014
  $ For those who already updated system to 10.9.3: If you want to uninstall previous Asepsis 1.4 at this point, we strongly recommend first updating to 1.4.1 and then using uninstaller from 1.4.1. Better to follow this well-tested path.
  + Asepsis installer requires installation of <a href="http://j.mp/cmdtools">Xcode command-line tools</a> as a pre-requisity (under OS X 10.9) - we need codesign command to be available, we don't bundle it anymore.
  ! In 10.9.3 system update, the kernel started doing additional security checks involving last modification times of binaries. This could <a href="https://github.com/binaryage/asepsis/issues/13">break Asepsis installation randomly</a>.
  ! Since next update, Sparkle updater will stop randomly asking for admin password (just enter an empty password if it asks again this time).
  * asepsisctl is more robust in situations when DesktopServicesPriv framework was replaced by system update.
  * Whole installer package is newly code-signed by BinaryAge. You don't have to change the default Security &amp; Privacy settings anymore.
  * Replaced the old uninstaller with a <a href="https://github.com/binaryage/uninstaller">custom Cocoa app</a> (the same we use with TotalFinder and TotalTerminal).
  * When invoking codesign command for signing our local DesktopServicesPriv wrapper, we instruct codesign to not contact time-stamping servers (the whole process should be off-line).

1.4 - November 07, 2013
  + Compatibility with OS X 10.9 (Mavericks). Discussion <a href="https://github.com/binaryage/asepsis/issues/9">here</a>.

1.3.2 - October 25, 2013
  ! Fixed broken uninstallation on some machines (<a href="https://github.com/binaryage/asepsis/issues/10">broken 'asepsisctl uninstall_wrapper' command</a>).

1.3.1 - October 11, 2013
  + Asepsis installation is prevented on unsupported systems (it is supported only on 10.7 and 10.8).
  ! Fixed broken 'asepsisctl clean' command.
  * 'asepsisctl' works under single-user mode.
  * Asepsis should not check for updates when network is not available (caused annoying "update error" dialog).

1.3 - June 13, 2012
  + Tested under almost final WWDC Mountain Lion developer preview.
  + The daemon does not listen to kernel extension anymore - it uses <a href="http://osxbook.com/software/fslogger">/dev/fsevents</a> instead.
  * Asepsis update checker has some delay and waits for network to become available.
  - Removed kernel extension =&gt; s/scary face/happy face/

1.2 - June 1, 2012
  $ Installing this version without uninstalling Asepsis 1.1 first will prevent your system from booting (shame on me).<br>You can fix it by booting into <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1492">single-user mode</a>. For more information please <a href="https://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/asepsis_1_2_doesnt_want_me_to_boot">visit this topic</a>.
  + Compatibility with OS X 10.7.4 and 10.8.
  + Integrated Sparkle updater.
  + Asepsis ignores .DS_Store files in Trash folders.
  * KEXT reports only folder operations.
  * KEXT does not spam Console.app log anymore.
  * Improved asepsisctl.

  + Migration commands in asepsisctl.
  + Diagnostics command in asepsisctl.
